Intro
{Am}  {G}  {F#}  {F}  (4x)

    {Am}                     {F}                        
My verses stand gawping a bit
                      {C}
I never get used to this they lived here long enough
  
Enough!

   {Am}                      {F}                  
I send them out of the house
                    {C}
I don't wanna wait until their toes are cold
  
Enough!

 {Am}                  {F}
I wanna hear the humming of the sun
    {C}
or that of my heart, hardening

Enough!

  {Am}                           {F}
they don't screw classically they babble commonly
{C}
and bluster nobly
           
Enough! Enough!


REFREIN:
{Am}                 {F}
In winter their lips leap
{C}                  {G}
in spring they lie flat at the first warmth
{Am}              {F}
They ruin my summer
{C}                   {G}
and in autumn it's girls and a broken heart


{Am}  {G}  {F#}  {F}  (4x)

      {Am}                          {F}
For another twelve lines on this sheet
                              {C}
I'll hold my hand over their head and then I'll kick them out

Enough!

 {Am}                {F}
Go and pester elsewhere,
               {C}
one-cent rhymes find somebody who cares

Enough!

 {Am}                     {F}
Go now on your high feet
                           {C}
this is where the graves laugh when they see their guests

Enough!

  {Am}                         {F}
One corpse on top of the other
                         {C}
go now and stagger to her whom I do not know
         
Enough! Enough!
