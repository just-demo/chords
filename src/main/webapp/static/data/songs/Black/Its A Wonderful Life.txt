{Em} {D} {G} {D} {Em}

SONG - 1ST VERSE

{Em}                {D}    {G}
Here I go out to sea again
                  {D}    {Em}
The sunshine fills my hair
                  {D}    {G}
And dreams hang in the air
                  {D}    {Em}
Gulls in the sky and in my blue eyes
                  {D}    {G}
You know it feels unfair
                  {D}    {Em}
There's magic everywhere


RIT.
                 {D}
Look at me standing
{G}              {C} 
Here on my own again
{Em}                    {D}
Up straight in the sunshine
{C}           {Em}      {G}
No need to run and hide
         {Em}          {C}       {D}
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
{C}           {Em}       {D}
No need to hide and cry
          {Em}      {C}       {D}
It's a wonderful, wonderful life

Em... (repeat as the 1st verse)
Sun in your eyes
The heat is in your hair
They seem to hate you
Because you're there

And I need a friend
Oh, I need a friend
To make me happy
Not stand here on my own

Look at me standing
Here on my own again
Up straight in the sunshine

I need a friend
Oh, I need friend
To make me happy
Not so alone
Look at me here
Here on my own again
Up straight in the sunshine
