{Em}             {C}                    {D}       {G}       {B7}   {Em}
My tea´s done cold, I´m wondering why I got out of bed at all
{Em}           {C}                 {D}         {D7}              {G}
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can´t see at all
         {Am}              {D}                     {G}        {D7}     {Em}
And even if I could it´d all be grey, but your picture on my wall
      {Am}               {C}                 {G}       {Em}
It reminds me that it´s not so bad, it´s not so bad.
{Em}            {C}                   {D}                {G}         {B7}        {Em}
I drank too much last night, got bills to pay, my head just feels in pain
{Em}            {C}                   {D}                {D7}             {G}
I missed the buss and there´ll be hell today, I´m late for work again
         {Am}                    {D}                 {G}         {D7}       {Em}   
And even if I´m there, they´ll all imply that I might not last the day
              {Am}              {C}                 {G}      {Em}    
And then you call me and it´s not so bad, it´s not so bad and


{G}           {C}            {G}                            {C}
I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
{G}           {C}              {G}                         {C}   
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life


{Em}
Push the door, I´m home at last and I´m soaking through and through
Then you hand me a towel and all I see is you
And even if my house falls down, I wouldn´t have a clue
Because you´re naer me and it´s not so bad, it´s not so bad and

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life
