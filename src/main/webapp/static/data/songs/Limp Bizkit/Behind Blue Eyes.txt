{Em}                     {G}               {D}
No one knows what it's like, to be the bad man,
          {C}          {A}
To be the sad man, behind blue eyes
{Em}                     {G}          {D}
No one knows what it's like to be hated,
      {C}                 {A}
To be fated, to telling only lies
 
CHORUS
       {C}  {D}                   {G}
But my dreams, they aren't as empty,
      {C}          {D}        {E}
As my conscience seems to be
       {Bm}           {C}
I have hours, only lonely
           {D}                      {A}
My love is vengeance that's never free
 
{Em}                     {G}                  {D}
No one knows what it's like to feel these feelings
       {C}       {A} 
Like I do, and I blame you
{Em}                   {G}             {D}
No one bites back as hard on their anger
        {C}                {A}
None of my pain and woe, can show through
 
CHORUS
 
{D}            {Bm}       {A}        {E}
When my fist clenches crack it open
         {Bm}         {G}       {D}
Before I use it and lose my cool
       {Bm}    {A}            {E}
When I smile tell me some bad news
         {Bm}        {A}          {E}
Before I laugh and act like a fool
 
And if I swallow anything evil
Stick your finger down my throat
If I shiver please give me a blanket
Keep me warm let me wear your coat
 
No one knows what it's like, to be the bad man
To be the sad man, BEHIND BLUE EYES
