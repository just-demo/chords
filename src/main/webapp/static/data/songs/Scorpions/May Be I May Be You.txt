solo

  May be i may be you
  I'm just dreaming sometimes
  But the world would be cold
  Without dream as like you

  May be i may be you
  I just soldie-eer of love
  Born to carry the flame
  Bringing lights to the dark

  And all us questions we mind
  All you need is to hear
  The voice of your heart

  In the world full of pain
  Someone is calling your name
  Why don't we make it true
  May be i may be you?

  May be i may be you!
  May be i may be you...ooo ooo ooo
