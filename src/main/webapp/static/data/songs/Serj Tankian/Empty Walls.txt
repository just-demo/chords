Your empty walls,
           {Gm}
Your empty walls,
            {Cm}
Pretentious adventures,
                {Gm}
Dismissive apprehension,
                 {Cm}
Don't waste your time,
           {Gm}
On coffins today,
        {Cm}
When we decline,
                     {Gm}
From the confines of our mind,
                 {Cm}
Don't waste your time,
           {Gm}
On coffins today...


{Cm}
Don't you see their bodies burning?
{Gm}
Desolate and full of yearning,
{Fm}
Dying of anticipation,
{D#}             ({Dm})
Choking from intoxication,


Don't you see their bodies burning?
Desolate and full of yearning,
Dying of anticipation,
Choking from intoxication,
{Cm}     {Gm}     {Fm} {D#}                      {Cm}
I want you to be left behind those empty walls,
     {Gm}     {Fm}  {D#}
Told you to see from behind those empty walls...

the chords donÂ´t change

Those empty walls,
When we decline,
From the confines of our mind,
Don't waste your time,
On coffins today...

Desolate and full of yearning,
Dying of anticipation,
Choking from intoxication,

Choking from intoxication,

I want you to be left behind those empty walls,
Told you to see from behind those empty walls,
Want you to be left behind those empty walls,
I told you to see from behind those empty walls,
From behind those empty walls,
From behind those empty walls,
The walls!
From behind those empty walls...

I left you yesterday,
(From behind those empty walls...)
Before you killed my family,
(From behind those empty walls, the walls...)

Don't you see their bodies burning?
Desolate and full of yearning,
Dying of anticipation,
Choking from intoxication,

From behind those empty walls,
(Trust your empty walls, trust your empty walls)
From behind those empty walls,
(Trust your empty walls, trust your empty walls)
from behind those empty walls,
Those walls!
Those walls!
